gnuCash-pud (Price Upload Daemon)
================================================================
Source code can be found on github.

This is a Qt service application. The gnuCash-pud allows share (stock) prices to be uploaded from a web based price service
(Alpha Vantage).
The software will only work with database based storage of gnuCash information (not xml!)

This has only been tested with mysql.

A file must be provided with the list of commodity values.


Command Line Usage
------------------

Configuration File
------------------
A configuration file located in /etc/gnuCash is used.
The configuration file name is gnuCash-pud.conf
Full path is then /etc/gnuCash/gnuCash-pud.conf


Documentation
-------------
The code is documented for use with doxygen.

Commodity Name File Format
---------------------------
There is one commodity code stored per line. The first item on the line must be the lookup code. This needs to correspond to the
[Security/currency] value in the Account Master. The second value in the line is the currency to use.
The items can be delimited with a space, tab or comma.

[Commodity Code], any other data required
WES.AX  AUD  Wesfarmers
WES.AX, AUD, Wesfarmers

Notes:
------
1.  Logging is to the local user directory. It is possible to set logging up to /var/log but this requires root setup before it will
    work. Therefore default is to log to local directory.
