gnuCash-price-upload
================================================================
Source code can be found on github.

gnuCash-price-upload allows share (stock) prices to be uploaded from a .csv file to the gnuCash database. This is a Qt console
application. The software will only work with database based storage of gnuCash information (not xml!)

This has only been tested with mysql.

The .csv file is expected to be in the format:
date, open, high, low, close, adj close, volume

date:       YYYY-MM-DD
open:       double
high:       double
low:        double
close:      double
adj_close:  double
volume:     std::uint64_t
